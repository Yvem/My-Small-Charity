My Small Charity
================

Welcome to My Small Charity. It is a simple Ruby on Rails application for managing a small charity.

Introduction
------------

I'm a member of several small charities, and I feel the need for some good tools. Unfortunately, existing tools are expensive and not suited for our needs.

I thus write my own application. It will include :
- a *good* CRM (I know what I mean)
- a distributed accounting module with currency support

Maybe, if I have time, I will add some collaborative features.

More details
------------

One day, I will write here...
